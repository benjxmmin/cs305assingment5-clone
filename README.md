### My Project:

I would like to work on a project that helps users locate potentially hidden files on their computer allows users to input ingredients that they have on hand, then output the different kinds of food they could make with it.

There are many reasons I want to make a project like this:
>
One being that I have kind of started a project like this before, but could not finish it due to lack of time/understanding of coding fundamentals.
>
Now I want to finish this code and continue improving it so that I can have a fully fleshed out program under my neck. 

#### Things that I may need to do in order to finish this project:

1. Learn how to search the web using the user's imputs
   - This includes returning some of the websearch results back to the user. 
   - Ohter thing
   - Other thing
2. Rework existing sections of the code
3. These are things that I would like to do
